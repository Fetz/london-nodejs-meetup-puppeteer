# Puppeteer

The main idea is to talk about puppeteer (how it works), what you can do with it, and other alternatives to it and in the end show a code demo testing a page with jest + puppeteer

The structure of the presentation should be something like this:

- About me (with twitter & github url)
- What is puppeteer?
- What can you use for?
  - scrapping (other alternatives cheerio)
  - browser testing (other alternatives cypress, selenium)
  - performance testing (other tools lighthouse and can be combined (still limit) with lighthouse)
  - visual diff (can be manually or integrated with applitools)
- Limitations of Puppeteer
- Testing:
  - When to use Puppeteer over Selenium?
  - When to use Selenium over Puppeteer?
  - Puppeter VS Cypress
- Scrapping:
  - When to use Puppeter
  - When to use cheerio
- Show a code demo with jest + puppeteer
- Links to the repo
