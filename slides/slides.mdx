### What is this all about?

Is a Google library that makes it simple to use Google Chrome DevTools Protocol

---

```mdx And what can I do with it?
1. Web crawling
2. UI/Browser testing
3. Performance testing
4. Code coverage
5. Capture Images or PDFs
6. Test Chrome extensions
7. Make Client Side App render on the server
----
* >
1 > even SPA
2 > Full or Headless
3 > You can get the metrics you get from devtools
4 > (both css and js)
5 > you can use it to diffs manually or with Aplitools
6 > yes even that
7 > Crawl the page and generate pre-rendered content
```

# Let's dig deeper
(and compare with some alternatives)

---

```mdx Web Crawling

|                      | Puppeteer | Cheerio | JSDom |
|----------------------|-----------|---------|-------|
|  classic HTML pages  |     X     |    X    |   X   |
|     SPA pages        |     X     |         |   *   |

----
* > 
3 > simple html page
4 > Single page application or Javascript rendered content

```mdx UI Browser Testing

|                 | Puppeteer | Cypress.io | Selenium |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|:--------:|
|      Chrome     |     X     |      X     |     X    |
|     Firefox     |           |   future   |     X    |
| Simulate mobile |     *     |            |     X    |

```mdx Why not Selenium

- Puppeteer is faster and more reliable 
- Not all tests are device, browser dependent
- More costly to mantain compared to Puppeteer
- You need to use a different testing framework

----
* > 
1 > since it has direct communication with browser
2 > SEO, metatags testing
3 > since they can be more flacky and slow
4 > Protractor, NightWatch, WebDriver.IO
```

---

```mdx Why not Cypress.io

- You need to use a different testing framework
- Last time, I used, you could only intercept XMLHttpRequest
- Less flexible (but it's documentation is awesome)
----
* > 
1 > it has their own testing framework
2 > so you can't intercept images
3 > Since it's focused for testing
```

---

```mdx So why use Puppeteer for testing?

1. you can use your current testing framework
2. faster (headless, direct communication) and more reliable*
3. powerful, you can intercept not only XMLHttpRequest
4. flexible tool, code coverage and performance testing...
5. Modern api
----
* > 
1 > You can use for example jest
2 > * compared to normal selenium based tests
3 > but as well images, and other requests
4 > 
5 > Async Wait
```

---

```mdx When not to use?

1. Device, browser dependent tests (CSS, markup)
2. If already using Cypress.io*
3. Documentation is good* but less examples online

----
* > 
1 > use Selenium based tests instead
2 > * expect for those especial cases
3 > * Cypress docs are better (my personal opinion)
```
---

```mdx Performance testing

1. Can be combined with Lighthouse (for some degree)
2. Can be used as a terminal script
3. Can be used as server side service
4. Can be used on the CI pipeline

----
* > 
1 > https://bit.ly/2yPxqtC
2 > since is a NodeJs library
3 > If you server can use a chrome browser
4 > For browser testing or performance testing
```

# Let's get our hands dirty!
(puppeteer + jest = UI testing)

---

# Easy way
(to setup)

---

```bash terminal
yarn add --dev jest-puppeteer
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```

---
```json package.json
{
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-puppeteer"
  }
}
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```
---

```js some.spec.js
describe('Google', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await page.goto('https://google.com');
  });

  it('should display "google" text on page', async () => {
    await expect(page).toMatch('google');
  });
});
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```
---

# The hard way
(so you can use it in any other test environment)

---
```json package.json
{
  "jest": {
    "globalSetup": "./test/setup.js",
    "globalTeardown": "./test/teardown.js",
    "testEnvironment": "./test/environment.js"
  }
}
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
3 > launch puppeteer
4 > close puppeteer
5 > connect to previously connected puppeteer

```mdx Troubleshooting

1. tests are timing out too soon
2. some interactions are failing or being ignored
3. some tests are flacky when running in CI
----
* > 
1 > increase your test framework timeouts e.g.: jest.setTimeout(time)
2 > wait for animations to finish
3 > run those tests with runInBand flag
```
