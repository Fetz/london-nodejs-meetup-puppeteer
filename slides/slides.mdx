## Puppeteer in action

### What is this all about?

Is a Google library that makes it simple to use Google Chrome DevTools Protocol

---

```mdx And what can I do with it?
1. Web crawling
2. UI/Browser testing
3. Performance testing
4. Code coverage
5. Capture Images or PDFs
6. Test Chrome extensions
----
* >
1 > even SPA
2 > Full or Headless
3 > You can get the metrics you get from devtools
4 > (both css and js)
5 > you can use it to diffs manually or with Aplitools
6 > yes even that
```

# Let's dig deeper

---

### Web Crawling

|                      | Puppeteer | Cheerio |
|----------------------|-----------|---------|
|  classic HTML pages  |     X     |    X    |
|       SPA pages      |     X     |         |

---

### UI Browser Testing

|                 | Puppeteer | Cypress.io | Selenium |
|-----------------|-----------|------------|:--------:|
|      Chrome     |     X     |      X     |     X    |
|     Firefox     |           |   future   |     X    |
| Simulate mobile |           |            |     X    |
|   Real devices  |           |            |     X    |

---

### Why not Selenium

* Puppeteer is faster and more reliable since it has direct communication with browser
* Not all tests are device, browser depedent (markup)
* More costly to mantain compared to Puppeteer
* You need to use a different testing framework

---

### Why not Cypress.io

* You need to use a different testing framework
* Last time, I used, you could only intercept XMLHttpRequest
* Less flexible (but it's documentation is awesome)

---

### So why use Puppeteer for testing?

1. you can use your current testing framework
2. faster (headless, direct communication) and more reliable compared to normal selenium based tests
3. powerful, you can intercept not only XMLHttpRequest, but as well images, and other requests
4. flexible tool, you can used it for code coverage and performance testing

---

### When not to use?

1. For those tests that are device, browser dependent (CSS, markup)
2. If already using Cypress.io, Puppeteer will probably not bring much value (expect for those especial cases)

---

### Performance testing

Can be combined with Lighthouse (for some degree)

---

# Let's get hands dirty!
(using puppeteer with jest)

---

# Easy way

---

```bash terminal
yarn add --dev jest-puppeteer
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```

---
```json package.json
{
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-puppeteer"
  }
}
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```
---

```js some.spec.js
describe('Google', () => {
  beforeAll(async () => {
    await page.goto('https://google.com');
  });

  it('should display "google" text on page', async () => {
    await expect(page).toMatch('google');
  });
});
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
```
---

# The hard way
(so you can use it in any other test environment)

---
```json package.json
{
  "jest": {
    "globalSetup": "./test/setup.js",
    "globalTeardown": "./test/teardown.js",
    "testEnvironment": "./test/environment.js"
  }
}
----
* > https://jestjs.io/docs/en/puppeteer
3 > launch puppeteer
4 > close puppeteer
5 > connect to previously connected puppeteer
```
